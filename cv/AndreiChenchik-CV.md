# Andrei Chenchik, iOS Software Engineer
---
I have 2 years of experience as a mobile engineer and over 7 years as a product lead in mobile apps. During my career, I went the whole way from a support specialist, though a frontend developer, and project and product lead and have chosen to grow as Swift Developer. I think the Swift ecosystem is the best one right now and has a chance to become significant in all fields (not just mobile) due to the constant evolution of the language and LLVM.

I believe that the only way to truly overcome a challenge is to build a deep understanding of the systems around it and then build your solution on top of that. That is why in my work I'm practising a holistic approach, and system thinking and constantly growing my knowledge in multiple disciplines like Mobile, Deep Learning, Backend, DevOps, etc.

Always looking forward to working and learning from dynamic teams, tackling hard challenges with lots of data, and complex and snappy UIs to deliver business value to customers.
