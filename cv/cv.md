# Andrei Chenchik, iOS Software Engineer
---
I have over 7 years in mobile apps as product lead and 1 year as developer. During my career I went the full way from a support specialist, though frontend developer, project and product leads and have choosen to grow as Swift Developer. I think the swift ecosystem is the best one right now and have all chances to become significant in all fields (not just mobile) due to constant evolution of the language and LLVM.

I believe that the only way to truly overcome a challenge is to build a deep understanding of the systems around it and then build your solution on top of that. That is why in my work I'm practicing a holistic approach, and system thinking and constantly growing my knowledge in multiple disciplines like Mobile, Deep Learning, Backend, DevOps, etc.

Always looking forward to working and learning from dynamic teams, tackling hard challenges with lots of data, and complex and snappy UIs to deliver business value to customers.

I've started this project in `Apr 2021` as learning project from the scratch in attempt to solve bill keeping problem that I have, and since then I'm improving it and trying new things. One of the most interesting challenge was to use `concurrency` for running `deep learning` network in background while still be able to save data with `CoreData`. And I have to comeup with `algorithm` to parse block of texts into list of cart items.
- It's 100% built using `SwiftUI`
- Using `CoreData` for data persistence with `CloudKit` for crossdevice synchronization
